        "Bob: That might reduce precision, though; would that impact personalization?\n",
        "Alice: Some, but we can re-rank on the client side for the top 10 results.\n",
        "Bob: Okay, so you are proposing a hybrid: coarse cache, fine rerank.\n",
        "Alice: Exactly. And we should log enough to measure drift each week.\n",
        "Bob: Logging is fine, but data retention policy caps at 30 days.\n",
        "Alice: Right, I can summarize weekly aggregates and delete raw events.\n",
        "Bob: Great. Also, the new API endpoint needs a version bump.\n",
        "Alice: v3 seems reasonable; we can keep v2 for a deprecation window.\n",
        "Bob: Then we need a migration guide; I can draft it.\n",
        "Alice: Thanks. Another point: the search index rebuild takes 6 hours.\n",
        "Bob: Maybe we can parallelize by shard and compress the postings lists.\n",
        "Alice: If we compress too much, we might slow decoding at query time.\n",
        "Bob: True; we could trade storage for CPU if latency budget allows.\n",
        "Alice: We'll benchmark both. Also, what about adding synonyms?\n",
        "Bob: Synonyms help recall, but they increase false positives.\n",
        "Alice: We'll tune the threshold and evaluate per-category.\n",
        "Bob: Sounds good. On another note, QA reported flaky tests.\n",
        "Alice: I saw that; I think the mock clock isn't resetting in CI.\n",
        "Bob: I can isolate those tests and add a fixture.\n",
        "Alice: Appreciate it. Lastly, are we aligned on the rollout plan?\n",
        "Bob: Staged rollout: internal, then 5% external, then 50%.\n",
        "Alice: And we monitor error rates and rollback if p95 spikes.\n",
        "Bob: Yes. I'll write the runbook.\n",
        "Alice: Great, I'll update the proposal and send it today.\n",
