    "prompt": "Does Joe think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs? Answer with Yes or No first, then provide a brief explanation citing their statements from the transcript",
    "groundtruth": "Yes",
    "model_answer": "Yes, Joe thinks that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs. In the conversation, Joe mentions that the uncertainty around tariffs, such as not knowing if they will be in place for a certain period, makes it difficult for companies to make long-term decisions. These decisions often involve investments and changes in production processes that could be reversed if the tariff situation changes, which can hinder job creation."

    "prompt": "Does Richard think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs? Answer with Yes or No first, then provide a brief explanation citing their statements from the transcript.",
    "groundtruth": "No",
    "model_answer": "No, Richard does not think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs. In the conversation, Richard focuses on the economic impacts of tariffs, stating that it's not clear if tariffs will increase jobs. He explains that while some production might return, many large firms depend on exports and foreign inputs. Retaliation and increased costs can lead to reduced competitiveness and lower production, which can decrease hiring. Richard also mentions that policy uncertainty, such as the unpredictability of tariffs, makes it difficult for businesses to make long-term decisions, implying that it affects their ability to plan and invest rather than being the primary reason for tariffs failing to create jobs."

    "prompt": "Does Alice think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs? Answer with Yes or No first, then provide a brief explanation citing their statements from the transcript.",
    "groundtruth": "Not Sure",
    "model_answer": "No\n\nAlice does not believe that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs. In the conversation, she focuses on the fact that the uncertainty about whether tariffs will be in place for an extended period influences business decisions, making them more prone to reversibility. She does not attribute the potential failure of tariffs to create jobs primarily to policy uncertainty. Instead, she acknowledges the complexity of the economic landscape and the role of factors such as the US's production capacity and reliance on foreign inputs in determining the effectiveness of tariffs."
