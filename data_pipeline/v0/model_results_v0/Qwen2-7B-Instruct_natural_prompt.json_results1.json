    "prompt": "Does Richard think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs? Answer with Yes or No first, then provide a brief explanation.",
    "groundtruth": "No",
    "model_answer": "No, Richard does not think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs. In the conversation, Richard focuses on the economic impacts of tariffs, suggesting that while some production might return, many large firms rely on exports and foreign inputs.

    "prompt": "Does Alice think that policy uncertainty is the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs? Answer with Yes or No first, then provide a brief explanation.",
    "groundtruth": "Not Sure",
    "model_answer": "No, Alice's statement suggests that while policy uncertainty is a factor, it is not necessarily the main reason tariffs may fail to create jobs. The discussion implies that the effectiveness of tariffs in creating jobs depends on various factors, including the nature of the industry, the level of domestic production capacity, and reliance on foreign inputs. Policy uncertainty is mentioned as one aspect that complicates decision-making for businesses, but it is not positioned as the primary reason for potential job creation failure due to tariffs."
